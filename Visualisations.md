* Casuals

Both have different behaviours and needs to use the bike service. 
In the following you will see the related analysis as well as the proposed strategies to increase revenue based on this analysis.


# Main Points # 

* Increase of 65% compared to 2011
* The main increase was related to registration (+68%) but casuals also doubled (+51%)

**Seasonality** 

* Seasons impact mostly casual riders who show more leisure usage 
* Registered are less impacted by seasons, however winter represents a low time for both groups.

**Usage Purposes** 

* Registered rides are more dictated by working hours during the week. There are 2 spikes occurring during the commuting time. 
* This shows that registered customer use the service for daily commuting and to move through the city. 

* Casual rides increases during the working time (10am - 5pm) and they remain relatively stable before decreasing. The trend has fewer peaks compared to registered. 
* Casuals might be tourists or leisure customers.

# Proposal to increase revenue # 

The key finding is that there are different behaviorus and needs for both target groups (registered, casual). 
While registered are more bounded to daily commuting and their rides are dicted by working hours, the casuals have a more flexible and stable usage of the service showing that leisure or daily plans (going to supermarket, gym etc.) influence their behaviour. 

Therefore we can plan to come up with two new product strategies for each of the target group. 

**Attract new casual riders**

* Launch a '10 to 5' ticket for casual drivers to attract them towards registrations
* Launch weekend tickets for casual drivers to attract them towards registrations

**Attract new registrations**

* Spring - Summer ticket campaign (April - October) to attract new customers to the service and potentially convert them once the campaign is over.
* Launch 'rush hour pass' for commuters to attract new registrations
